                        Tarot Reading is a modern web application that brings the
                        traditional Rider–Waite–Smith tarot deck into a digital
                        experience. Users can shuffle the deck, perform different
                        types of readings, and explore every card in an intuitive
                        and responsive interface.

                        <p>
                            Every reading begins with a fully randomized deck,
                            ensuring that each card draw is unique. This creates a
                            fresh experience every time you perform a reading,
                            closely resembling the process of shuffling a physical
                            tarot deck.
